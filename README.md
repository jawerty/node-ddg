# node-ddg
Node.js wrapper for DuckDuckGo's Instant Answers API. 

# Install
```
$ npm install ddg
```

It's that simple.

# Usage
```js
ddg = require('ddg');

ddg.query("duckduckgo", function(err, data){
	console.log(data) // logs a dictionary with all return fields
});
```

See the instant answers API docs for more information on the return fields <https://api.duckduckgo.com/api>

### Custom options
```js
ddg = require('ddg');

options = {
	"useragent": "My duckduckgo app",
	"no_redirects": "1",
	"no_html": "0",
}

ddg.query('duckduckgo', options, function(err, data){
	console.log(data)
});
```
List of all options
* useragent
* format (json or xml)
* pretty (default: 1)
* no_html (default: 0)
* skip_disambig (default: 0)
* no_redirects (default: 1)

### Getting query AbstractText
Here I'm making a query for 'bioshock' and loging the AbstractText taken from Wikipedia.
```js
ddg = require('ddg');

ddg.query('bioshock', options, function(err, data){
	console.log(data.AbstractText)
});
```
Output:

	BioShock is a first-person shooter video game developed by Irrational Games (at the time, named 2K Boston), and published by 2K Games.

### Generating information from results (url,text)
With Instant Answers API + node-ddg it becomes quite simple to get duckduckgo data.
```js
ddg = require('ddg')

ddg.query('bioshock', function(err, data){
	results = data.RelatedTopics; //related topics is a list of 'related answers'
	for (i=0;i<results.length;i++) {
		console.log(''+results[i].FirstURL)
		console.log('-- '+results[i].Text)
		console.log('\n')
	}
});
```
Output:

	http://duckduckgo.com/BioShock_(series)
	-- BioShock (series) - BioShock is a first-person shooter video game series 
	developed by Irrational Games—the first under the name 2K Boston/2K Australia—and 
	designed by Ken Levine.

Now you can get and manipulate data from the API in a clean and asynchronous fashion.

### Access fields directly
If you want to get one specific field and nothing else, you can use **the field you want as a method** and run it as seen below.
```js
ddg = require('ddg');

ddg.Definition('lion', function(err, data){
	console.log(data)
});
```
Output:

	 lion definition: a large heavily built social cat ('''Panthera leo''') of open or
	 rocky areas chiefly of sub-Saharan Africa though once widely distributed 
	 throughout Africa and southern Asia that has a tawny body with a tufted tail and
	  a shaggy blackish or dark brown mane in the male.
